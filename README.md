This crate provides a `tower::Layer` that translates `hyper`/`axum` requests to the format used by the `aws-lambda-rust-runtime` crate. This allows users to switch between just running a Hyper server, and running under the Lambda runtime - this dramatically speeds up development! It also means that you can use off-the-shelf components from the Tower ecosystem!

Check out `examples/main.rs`: running in debug mode runs a hyper server, and building for release mode compiles using the Lambda runtime.

### Testing out the Lambda runtime locally

I have also provided an example Dockerfile & python script for locally spinning up a lambda runtime:
```
cargo build --release --example main
docker build . -t lambda-test
docker run -p 9000:8080 lambda-test
python test_lambda_runtime
```
